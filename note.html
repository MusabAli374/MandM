      <p>Hello Mina, my comfort place, my partner, my love. You are more than anything I could ever ask for in a person. Thank you for being my cushion, thank you for smiling at me every day when I came back home tired, thank you for enjoying every little moment with me, and more than anything: thank you for being you. You add colour and calmness to my life, you really are the pink side of batman, and I hope to be with you forever more. 242 days together - that has a good rhyme to it, but as I always say: we have a lifetime to spend together. Stay happy, stay blessed, my prayers will always include your name insha'Allah, and I will fight for you. I am sorry if I hurt you along the journey, and I hope that while I make my mistakes, you can overlook some, and hit me with a pan for some (I'm kidding, don't make that face). I love you, always take care, always be the reason for the smile on so many faces. You're beautiful, all those flowers are nothing in comparison.</p>
